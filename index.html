        <p>Pangolins or scaly anteaters[1] are mammals of the order Pholidota (from the Greek word φολῐ́ς, "horny scale"). </p>
        <p>The one extant family, Manidae, has three genera: Manis, which comprises four species living in Asia; Phataginus, which comprises two species living in Africa; and Smutsia, which comprises two species also living in Africa.</p>
        <p>These species range in size from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number of extinct pangolin species are also known.</p>
